# Instructions to Run the Cylinder Volume Calculator Program in Linux Environment

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have `g++` installed on your Linux system. If not, you can install it using your package manager.

## Steps
1. **Download the Source Code:**
   - Download the `cylinder_volume.cpp` file to your Linux environment. You can download it from a website or copy it from your local machine to the Linux environment.

2. **Open Terminal:**
   - Open a terminal window on your Linux system. You can typically do this by searching for "Terminal" in your system's applications or using a keyboard shortcut like `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

3. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where the `cylinder_volume.cpp` file is located. For example:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Downloads
     ```

4. **Compile the Program:**
   - Once you're in the directory containing `cylinder_volume.cpp`, compile the program using the `g++` compiler:
     ```bash
     g++ -o cylinder_volume cylinder_volume.cpp
     ```

5. **Run the Program:**
   - After successful compilation, execute the program by running:
     ```bash
     ./cylinder_volume
     ```

6. **Input Cylinder Dimensions:**
   - Follow the prompts in the terminal to enter the radius and height of the cylinder.

7. **View the Result:**
   - The program will calculate and display the volume of the cylinder in the terminal.

8. **Repeat or Exit:**
   - You can run the program again with different inputs by following steps 5-7, or you can exit the program by closing the terminal window or pressing `Ctrl + C`.
