# Instructions to Compile and Run the Program to Display a Number in Scientific Notation

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have `g++` installed on your Linux system. If not, you can install it using your package manager.

## Steps
1. **Download the Source Code:**
   - Download the [scientific_notation.c](link_to_scientific_notation.c) file to your Linux environment.

2. **Open Terminal:**
   - Open a terminal window on your Linux system.

3. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where the `scientific_notation.c` file is located. For example:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Downloads
     ```

4. **Compile the Program:**
   - Once you're in the directory containing `scientific_notation.c`, compile the program using the `g++` compiler with the following command:
     ```bash
     g++ -o scientific_notation scientific_notation.c
     ```

5. **Run the Program:**
   - After successful compilation, execute the program by running:
     ```bash
     ./scientific_notation
     ```

6. **Input Number:**
   - Follow the prompt in the terminal to enter a number.

7. **View the Output:**
   - The program will display the entered number in scientific notation.

8. **Repeat or Exit:**
   - You can run the program again with different inputs or exit it by closing the terminal window or pressing `Ctrl + C`.
